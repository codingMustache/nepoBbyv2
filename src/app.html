	The properties include descriptive meta-data about the article that we specifically want to present when someone
	shares the article.

	Basic Tags
	These are the most basic meta tags that you should use for all content types:

	Tag Description
	og:url

	The canonical URL for your page. This should be the undecorated URL, without session variables, user identifying
	parameters, or counters. Likes and Shares for this URL will aggregate at this URL. For example, mobile domain URLs
	should point to the desktop version of the URL as the canonical URL to aggregate Likes and Shares across different
	versions of the page.

	og:title

	The title of your article without any branding such as your site name.

	og:description

	A brief description of the content, usually between 2 and 4 sentences. This will displayed below the title of the post
	on Facebook.

	og:image

	The URL of the image that appears when someone shares the content to Facebook. See below for more info, and check out
	our best practices guide to learn how to specify a high quality preview image.

	fb:app_id

	In order to use Facebook Insights you must add the app ID to your page. Insights lets you view analytics for traffic
	to your site from Facebook. Find the app ID in your App Dashboard.


	You may also want to add two additional tags to improve distribution of your content and more engagement:

	Tag Description
	og:type

	The type of media of your content. This tag impacts how your content shows up in Feed. If you don't specify a type,the
	default is website. Each URL should be a single object, so multiple og:type values are not possible. Find the full
	list of object types in Object Types Reference

	og:locale

	The locale of the resource. Defaults to en_US. You can also use og:locale:alternate if you have other available
	language translations available. Learn about the locales we support in our documentation on localization.


	The full list of standard object properties is in our Object Properties Reference.

	Test Your Markup
	To see how your markup appears to the Facebook Crawler enter a URL into Sharing Debugger. It will show which meta tags
	the crawler scrapes as well as any errors or warnings.

	The debugger also triggers a scrape of your page, so if you do have errors in your HTML you can use the debugger to
	update your content. See Updating Objects to learn more.


	Test Whether Facebook User-Agent Is Handled Properly
	Open your browser.
	Change the user-agent to match FB user-agent. For more information on changing the user-agent, see
	http://osxdaily.com/2013/01/16/change-user-agent-chrome-safari-firefox/:
	Develop Menu > User-Agent > Other
	Set user-agent to: facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php)
	Load the problem URL.
	Set the user-agent to that of a mobile browser, say Safari - iPhone:
	Develop Menu > User-Agent > Safari — iOS 10 — iPhone
	Load the problem URL.
	If this is a user-agent issue, the page will load correctly in Step 5 but not Step 3.
	Media Content Types
	You can add additional markup if your content includes audio, video, or location information. See all standard object
	properties in our Object Types Reference.

	Video
	You can use og:video for all content types. This section describes how to use additional tags to optimize the look of
	videos on Facebook. Facebook supports both mp4 and Flash videos.

	Use a secure URL for both the og:video:url and og:video:secure_url tags to make your video eligible to play in-line in
	Feed. Note that your video is not guaranteed to play in-line based on a variety of factors.

	Meta tag Description
	og:video

	The URL for the video. If you want the video to play in-line in Feed, you should use the https:// URL if possible.

	og:video:url

	Equivalent to og:video

	og:video:secure_url

	Secure URL for the video. Include this even if you set the secure URL in og:video.

	og:video:type

	MIME type of the video. Either application/x-shockwave-flash or video/mp4.

	og:video:width

	Width of video in pixels. This property is required for videos.

	og:video:height

	Height of video in pixels. This property is required for videos.

	og:image

	Specify an image for a high quality preview in Feed


	Images
	Use this set of properties for content that contains more than one image. See Sharing Best Practices for guidance on
	how best to use og:image.

	Meta tag Description
	og:image

	URL for the image. To update an image after it's been published, use a new URL for the new image. Images are cached
	based on the URL and won't be updated unless the URL changes.

	og:image:url

	Equivalent to og:image

	og:image:secure_url

	https:// URL for the image

	og:image:type

	MIME type of the image. One of image/jpeg, image/gif or image/png

	og:image:width

	Width of image in pixels. Specify height and width for your image to ensure that the image loads properly the first
	time it's shared.

	og:image:height

	Height of image in pixels. Specify height and width for your image to ensure that the image loads properly the first
	time it's shared.
